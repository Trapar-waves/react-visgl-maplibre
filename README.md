> A React-based library that integrates MapLibre, Deck.gl, and Three.js for advanced geospatial data visualization.

## ✨ Features

- **React Integration:** Built using React for a component-driven architecture, allowing seamless integration into React applications.
- **Geospatial Data Visualization:** Utilizes Deck.gl and MapLibre to provide rich geospatial data visualization capabilities.
- **3D Rendering with Three.js:** Employs `@react-three/fiber` and `three` to enable 3D rendering and interactive 3D experiences within the map interface.
- **Layer-Based Design:** Offers support for multiple layers (via Deck.gl) such as aggregation layers, geo-layers, and custom Mapbox-compatible layers.
- **Data Loading & Parsing:** Includes loaders like `@loaders.gl/core` and `@loaders.gl/csv` to handle various data formats (CSV, 3D Tiles, etc.), making it easier to work with large datasets.
- **Tailwind CSS Styling:** Employs Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, offering flexibility in UI customization.
- **Modern Build Workflow:** Built with Rsbuild for optimized development builds and hot module replacement, ensuring a fast and efficient development cycle.
- **Type Safety:** Leverages TypeScript (`@types/react`, `@types/three`) to enhance code reliability and developer experience.
